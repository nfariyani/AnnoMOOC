453,783,hari ini komputer grafis adalah bagian sentral dari kehidupan kita di film game komputer aided desain virtual simulator visualisasi dan bahkan produk dan kamera pencitraan  kursus ini mengajarkan dasar dasar grafik komputer yang berlaku untuk semua domain ini  nstudents akan belajar untuk membuat gambar yang dihasilkan komputer dari adegan  d termasuk flybys objek membuat penampil adegan real time dan membuat gambar yang sangat realistis dengan raytracing  kita akan mulai dengan contoh sederhana melihat teko dari mana saja di ruang angkasa memahami matematika dasar penempatan kamera virtual  selanjutnya anda akan belajar bagaimana menggunakan bahasa pemrograman grafis real time seperti opengl dan glsl untuk membuat penampil scene anda sendiri memungkinkan anda untuk terbang dan memanipulasi adegan  d  akhirnya kami akan mengajari anda untuk membuat gambar yang sangat realistis dengan pantulan dan bayangan menggunakan raytracing cse   x mengajarkan dasar dasar grafik komputer  kursus ini berlangsung selama   minggu dan terdiri dari empat segmen  setiap segmen termasuk penugasan pemrograman individual n nviewview dan pekerjaan rumah matematika dasar      dari ntransformasi kelas pekerjaan rumah      kelas nopengl dan penerangan pekerjaan rumah      kelas nraytracing pekerjaan rumah      dari siswa kelas n nis yang mendapatkan skor total    atau lebih besar akan lulus kursus dan dapat memperoleh sertifikat dari uc san diegox  n nfaq nwhat adalah format kelas yang kelasnya akan terdiri dari video ceramah latihan singkat dan pekerjaan rumah  masing masing dari empat segmen kursus akan memiliki     kuliah  setiap ceramah termasuk     video ceramah yang berlangsung antara    dan    menit  akan ada latihan singkat setelah setiap video ceramah untuk membantu anda menguji pemahaman anda tentang materi  nilai nyour akan ditentukan sepenuhnya oleh tugas pemrograman yang akan anda terima umpan balik autograder langsung  anda dapat mengirimkan tugas anda ke autograder beberapa kali hanya pengiriman terakhir anda akan dihitung  proyek nprogramming harus diimplementasikan secara individual tanpa menyalin kode dari siswa lain yang sebagian besar sumber daya online identik atau contoh sebelumnya dari kelas  namun singkat dari posting atau berbagi kode eksplisit yang sebenarnya anda didorong untuk berkolaborasi dan mendiskusikan masalah dalam forum diskusi  nakan teks kuliah tersedia nyes  semua kuliah kami akan memiliki transkrip yang disinkronkan ke video  ndo saya harus menonton ceramah hidup nno  anda dapat menonton ceramah di waktu luang anda  anda dapat mengemudikan  ke depan jika anda ingin bergerak lebih cepat dari tanggal jatuh tempo  sebaliknya anda dapat maju dengan kecepatan yang lebih lambat  harap perhatikan bahwa sertifikat hanya akan diberikan kepada siswa yang memperoleh skor yang diperlukan dengan menyerahkan tugas dengan tenggat waktu yang ditetapkan  nhow banyak biaya untuk mengambil kursus tidak tentu saja gratis  jika anda berharap untuk melakukan banyak pemrograman grafis di masa depan kami akan merekomendasikan panduan pemrograman opengl dan glsl tetapi itu tidak berarti diperlukan untuk membelinya  ada banyak sumber daya online gratis untuk topik ini dan kami akan memposting tautan ke mereka  sistem komputer apa yang saya perlukan untuk kursus tentu saja melibatkan pemrograman c    opengl glsl yang portabel  kami menyediakan kode kerangka untuk semua platform utama windows mac os linux  ini adalah kursus modern yang melibatkan shader terprogram tetapi setiap mesin yang dibangun dalam beberapa tahun terakhir harus memadai  kami menyediakan banyak petunjuk kompilasi  tips  dan pekerjaan rumah   adalah untuk memastikan anda dapat mengkompilasi dan bekerja dengan autograder  anda perlu beberapa jenis lingkungan pengembangan c    kami menyediakan beberapa sumber daya untuk anda memulai untuk pekerjaan rumah    dalam peristiwa yang sangat tidak mungkin anda tidak bisa mendapatkan mesin anda untuk bekerja anda diharapkan akan memiliki waktu yang cukup untuk menemukan sistem lain  nakan saya belajar maya directx  d studio max dll nthis adalah kursus tentang dasar dasar grafik komputer dan mencakup konsep konsep bukan seluk beluk paket perangkat lunak tertentu  yang mengatakan anda akan dapat menulis program grafis  d interaktif dan offline yang kompleks di akhir kursus di c    opengl dan glsl  saya dapat menghubungi instruktur atau asisten pengajar  tetapi tidak secara langsung  forum diskusi adalah tempat yang tepat untuk pertanyaan tentang kursus  instruktur akan memonitor forum diskusi dan mencoba menjawab pertanyaan yang paling penting dalam banyak kasus  respon dari siswa lain dan teman sebaya akan memadai dan lebih cepat  ni memiliki kecacatan pendengaran cacat  dll  dapatkah saya mengambil kursus nin sebagian besar kasus ya  kami menyediakan transkrip untuk semua kuliah  banyak peneliti grafis komputer terkemuka memiliki gangguan penglihatan seperti buta warna  namun ini menjadi kursus komputer grafis yang bergantung pada perbandingan gambar visual  kami mungkin tidak dapat memberikan dukungan yang memadai bagi mereka yang buta secara hukum  ni punya jadwal sibuk musim gugur ini  dapatkah saya tetap mengambil kursus tidak memerlukan sekitar    jam per minggu kerja dan tugas di mana anda diberikan dua minggu membutuhkan waktu  sertifikat prestasi membutuhkan skor kelulusan  tentu saja anda dipersilakan untuk hanya mengikuti kuliah atau mencoba beberapa tugas jika anda tidak tertarik dengan sertifikat kami berharap
